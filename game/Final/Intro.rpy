    pr "It's been years since I started working here."
    pr "Nobody ever realy asked why, guess I'm not really the type people make chitchat with."
    pr "What does suprise me is how very few people ever ask me what I'm doing."
    pr "Million dollar equipment? Sure. A 20 man team? Here you go. 5 billion dollars? For research? You act like you think I'm gonna say no."
    pr "Funny, for all I've ever done, they only know about a select few things. They think that's what I'm pouring all these years into, all their money into."
    pr "They don't know jack shit, but they're still impressed."
    pr "I don't really know what that means, if I'm some smart-ass who pulls off miracles during his coffee break, or I just have the right approach..."
    pr "I'd say the latter. I may work for a big pharmaceutical company, but management aren't as dumb as most places. They know a stem cell from \"Deep fortifying face cream with pyrogenic nano-bubbles!\"."
    pr "Still, I'm amazed that no-one checks up on me too much. I guess just looking at the notes I make every once in a while on what I'm supposed to be doing makes them think I'm working harder than anyone here."
    pr "Which sadly isn't what I really want, I'd prefer to float in the grey, but I don't want to become nobody."
    pr "Still, I guess I get the most funding, who's gonna bitch?"
    pr "So what do I show them, you ask?"
    pr "When I'm bored or my brain's just a bit worn out, I work on what my paycheck says I do, cures for illnesses. Viruses. Whatever I feel like."
    pr "They really don't mind, as long as I'm fixing something."
    pr "It means they don't ever know exactly what we're doing, just what we give them, and that's enough."
    pr "I've been told the cures I come up with are insanely brilliant, that I'd have to be some crazy genius to even work them out, they wouldn't believe me if I told them I spent maybe 3 hours every Friday making them."
    pr "Although they'd be wrong, about the first thing, that is. I'm no genius, it's what I do for the rest of the week, with the rest of the money, the stuff I don't tell them about which kinda lets me come up with cures rather quickly and effortlessly."
    pr "Some may say what I do then isn't really moral, that it isn't how a scientist would do things, that the payoff wasn't worth the cost."
    pr "They don't know why I'm really doing it though."
    pr "I'm not some delusional scientist that thinks it's okay to take a huge risk for all the people it saves."
    pr "What I'm doing is completely intentional. The dangerous means aren't a way of getting somewhere, they're my goal."
    pr "You see, this is why I don't want the higher ups paying too much attention. If they realized what I was doing they'd question why. Their first answer would be \"Off-the-books reckless but dammit you get the job done\" kinda thing, but they wouldn't believe that for too long."
    pr "They'd soon realize why I was really doing what I'm doing, they wouldn't think for a second before firing me, risks-for-the-good-of-humanity goes out the door when they realize I don't give a shit about the good of humanity and I'm doing this specifically against that cause."
    pr "No one in my team really knows why they're doing what they're doing, they get orders from me and they do them."
    pr "There are those who do think reach the \"dammit you get the job done\" thing, but they think management has the same ideas but is happy with it, so they keep quiet."
    pr "It's fun being the translator in an anti-censorship club."
    pr "Anyway, more specifics. My project isn't working on anything inherently bad, I'm not even really using it for BAD, I'm just giving it to bad to see what bad does with it."
    pr "Same goes for good for a couple hours a week, and management like that."
    pr "How does this shit work, you ask? Well, basic evolution works by tiny changes happening when an organism recreates itself..."
    pr "...and the resulting changes, mutations, affect the organism's chances of yet again recreating itself."
    pr "Spread this over billions of years and you get, well, all living shit."
    pr "For humans, this process happens once every 20 or so years. Viruses can do so in minutes."
    pr "But the difference between the times is really not that big, 20 years might as well be 2 minutes, cool shit is still not gonna happen in my lifetime."
    pr "Because most copies end up being too close to the original it takes ages before you even get a chance at something cool, and that chance is still probably 1 in a million."
    pr "I decided to speed up this process by making every copy, every child, have a lot more changes than usual."
    pr "Radiation tends to do the same, but it just shreads the DNA, leaving utter destruction."
    pr "What I wanted is to affect every child, but not so drastically."
    pr "I did this by using a organism of my own, a virus that lives on, or really just bonds to other viruses, changing their copys."
    pr "Nice, non-destructive, doesn't really hurt the viruses. No need to reengineer every bloody organism I want to work on, just shake and go"
    pr "The effect? Well, a medicine might kill 99.99\% of viruses, but that 1 in 10 billion retard virus babby with the genetic fuck-up that makes it immune to penicillin is gonna be the Adam of a new race."
    pr "The shit I've created in this lab out of the virus samples that I'm supposed to be trying to kill scare even me, though that doesn't stop me from carrying a little vial of airborne Cuevavirus Lloviu around my neck."
    pr "If people ask, I just say it's part of a cure to cancer. Heh..."
    pr "Anyway, thanks to the, well, enhancing organism I made being self-replicating, I've been able to apply it to almost..."

    pr "But you've never interrupted me like that before, I've never had the chance to say shit actively."

    pr "Well, to be honest, I'm not the one resposible for these works."
    bsg "Plagiarism? Elaborate."
    pr "No, not that. You see, rather than bashing my brain on working out solutions to problems, I just let evolution do its thing and study the results."
    pr "My findings are based on the most fit cells that fight the issue, I reverse engineer them from there, and compare the changes."
    bn "That's not how it works you little shit, but fuck it, why not? We're getting kinda desperate."
    bsg "Tell me, how on Earth do you make so many permutations? That would take years, you've fixed things thrown at you in a couple of days! Small as they may have been, they where somewhat groundbreaking none the less. How do you do this?"
    pr "Well, I use something I created ages ago. It's a very basic thing that promotes changes in every single offspring, nothing too fancy, I found it by sheer luck. But when I apply it to some of the more common cells in humans and expose the results to viruses, the good cells literally just sit there, waiting for me to notice them."
    bsg "How much of this, well, mutagen, have you got? Have you tried using it on Ebola?"
    pr "I-I'm sorry, what?"
    bsg "Have you applied the resulting cells to Ebola samples to see if anything will hurt it?"
    pr "Oh, sorry. Um, no. Not yet. Not recently, at least."
    bsg "Coudl we run through it now? We have all day, and it's what the world needs right now."
    pr "Sure, we can do it now. Nye, grab that incubator over there, Sian, get me a Ebola sample pack."
