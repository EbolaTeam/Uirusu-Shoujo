    plh "The protagonist finds himself at the bank of a river blacker than the depths of space."
    plh "There is a young girl wielding a scythe standing next to a small boat."
    plh "She motions for him to get in. He has no choice but to comply."
    plh "Joki, the girl, begins to row the boat using her scythe, and they set off to the underworld."
    plh "During the boat trip, the protagonist gets dizzy, and is pulled into the river by Pestilence, who is very impressed with the protagonist's work, and has decided to resurrect the protagonist as a rare male virus, carrying the traits of high survivability, high infectivity, and high mutation rate - but lacking in lethality."
    plh "He then blacks out in the shadow of Pestilence."
    plh "When he opens his eyes again, he's on an examining table, surrounded by many of the characters of the Virus World."
    plh "Perform introductions for a few, probably Ebby, Polio-sensei, and Autism-sama, and visually reveal the others."
    plh "It is explained that Joki brought him to the institute after he floated to the surface, not knowing what else to do with him."
    plh "As he regains his senses, the others leave him in the care of Ebby, who apologizes profusely for hurting him, though she is glad to see that he found her again and seems to be intact."
    plh "She now has Skully, which speaks in a rattly voice noted to be quite similar to the protagonist's own, though it says things he would not say."
    plh "Protag-kun is given a room, some basic clothing, and a phone that works on the local network, and allowed to \"sleep it off\" for a while."
    plh "Once he awakes, hungry, he follows his nose to find the cafeteria and begins to meet other characters."
