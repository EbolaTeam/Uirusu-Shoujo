"Me" "Hello!"
"Me" "Just a little pre-demo explanation thingy"
"Me" "I don't intend any specifc things here to be part of the plot..."
"Me" "But I think what we need most right now is a frame for everyone to work in."
"Me" "Xebec's thing here is a good example, a basic layot of possible events that we can go and fill in."
"Me" "For example, the little story Linder wrote about zmapp and ebby chasing eachother could fit perfectly if someone just threw it into what xebec has."
"Me" "I think it woud be good if someone make a more broader framework that we can all throw our little pieces into, potentially even something we could throw smaller little frames into"
"Me" "That is what I intend to do here."
"Me" "If anyone has any ideas please feel free to throw them inside this scrypt somewhere."
"Me" "Just find somewhere you think they'll fit and throw them in."
"Me" "Althoutgh I do have 1 request..."
"Me" "Leave at least 3 lines space between the top and bottom of what you do, like so:"






"Me" "People looking through the .rpy know what I'm talking about"
"Me" "Anyway, that's basicly it. Just lop out any 3 sequence events that look like they where written to fill space"
"Me" "However, if you see something it looks like someone wrote, or tried to wright, as a proper scene, just put your bit after it."
"Me" "Maybe say something like \"The following is what could have happened after SARS raped that mosquito\" or something, just so we know where you're coming from."
"Me" "I've thrown in bits of everyone's stuff so you can have an idea of how we could all build off the base"
"Me" "Nothing's set in stone, this is mainly just to get us all started"

pr "It's been years since I started working here."
pr "Nobody ever realy asked why, guess I'm not really the type people make chitchat with."
pr "What does suprised me is how very few people ever ask me what I'm doing"
pr "\"Million dollar equiptment? Sure. A 20 man team? Here you go. 5 billion dollars? For research? You act like you think I'm gonna say no.\""
pr "Funny, for all I've ever done they only know about a select few things, thet think that's what I'm pouring all these years into, all their money into."
pr "They don't know jack shit, but they're still impressed."
pr "I don't really know what that means, if I'm some smartass who pulls off miricals in his coffee break, the higher upps know nothing about science, or I just have the right approach..."
pr "I'd say the last, I may work for a big pharmasutical company but management aren't as dumb as most places, they know a stem cell from \"Deep fortifying face cream with progenic nanobubbles!\"."
pr "Still, supprised no-one checks up on me too much. I guess just looking at the notes I make every once in a while on what I'm supposed to be doing makes them think I'm working harder than anyone here."
pr "Which sadly isn't what I really want, I'd prefer to float in the grey, but I don't want to become nobody."
pr "Still, I guess I get the most money, who's gonna bitch?"
pr "So what do I show them you ask?"
pr "When I'm boored or my brain's just a bit worn out I work on what my paycheck says I do, cures for illnusses. Viruses. Whatever I feel like."
pr "They really don't mind, as long as I'm fixing something"
pr "It means they don't ever know exactly what we're doing, just what we give them, and that's enough"
pr "Some may say the cures I come up with are insanly brilliant, that I'd have to be some crazy genius to even work them out, they wouldn't beleive me if I told them I spent maybe 3 hours every friday making them."
pr "Although they'd be wrong, about the first thing, that is. I'm no genius, it's what I do for the rest of the week, with the rest of the money, the stuff I don't tell them about which kinda lets me come up with cures rather quickly and effortlessly."
pr "Some may say what I do then isn't really moral, that it isn't how a scientist would do things, that the payoff wasn't worth the cost."
pr "They don't know why I'm really doing it though."
pr "I'm not some delusionall scientist that thinks it's okay to take a huge risk for all the people it saves."
pr "What I'm doing is compleatly intentional. The dangerous means aren't a way of getting somewhere, they're my goal."
pr "You see, this is why I don't want the higher ups paying too much attention, if they realised what I was doing they'd wuestion why. Their first answer would be \"Off-the-books reckless but dammit you get the job done\" kinda thing, but they wouldn't beleive that."
pr "They'd soon realise why I was really doing what I'm doing, they wouldn't think for a second before firing me, risks-for-the-good-of-humanity goes out the door when they realise I don't give a shit about the good of humanity and I'm doing this specificly against that cause."
pr "Not even most of my team really knows why they're doing what their doing, they get orders from me and they do them"
pr "Those who do think reach the \"dammit you get the job done\" thing, and they thing management has the same idea's but is happy with it, so they keep quiet."
pr "It's fun being the translator man in the anti-censorship club."
pr "Anyway, more specifics. My project isn't working on anything inherintly bad, I'm not even really using it for BAD, I'm just giving it to bad to see what bad does with it."
pr "Same goes for good for a couple hours a week, and management like that."
pr "How does this shit work you ask? Well, baic evolution works by tiny changes happening when an organism recreates itself..."
pr "...and the resulting changes, mutations, affecting the oranism's chances of yet again recreating itself."
pr "Spread this over billions of years and you get, well, all living shit."
pr "For humans this process happenes once ever 20 or so years, viruses can do so in minutes."
pr "But the difference between the times is really not that big, 20 years might as well be 2 minutes, cool shit's still not gonna happen in my lifetime"
pr "Because most copies end up being too close to the original it takes ages before you even get a chace at something cool, and that chance is still probably 1 in a million."
pr "A medicin might kill 99.99\% of viruses, but that 1 in 10 billion retard virus babby with the genetic fuckup thatmakes it immune to penicilin's gonna be the Adam of a new race"
pr "I decided to speed up this process by making each copy, each child, have a lot more changes than usuall."
pr "Radiation tends to do the same but it just shreads the DNA leaving utter destruction."
pr "What I wanted is to affect every child, but not so drasticly."
pr "I did this by using a organism of my own, a virus that lives on, or really just bondes to other viruses, changing their coppy's."
pr "Nice, non-destructive, doesn't really hurt the viruses. No need to reengineer every bloody organism I want to work on, just shake and go"
pr "The shit I've created in this lab out of the virus samples I'm supposed to be trying to kill scare even me, doesn't stop me from carrying a little viril of airborne Cuevavirus Lloviu around my neck."
pr "If people ask I just say it's part of a cure to cancer. Heh..."
pr "Anyway, thanks to the, well, enhancing organism I made being self-replicating I've been able to apply it to almost..."

pr "But you've never inturupted me like that before, I've never had the chance to say shit activly."

pr "Well, to be honest, I didn't really do it how you'd think"
bsg "Elaborate"

pr "My finding are based on the most fit cells that fight the issue, I reverse engineer them from there, compare the changes."
bsg "That's totally, utterly cheating and I love it. But how do you make so many permutations? That would take years, you've fixed thing thrown at you in a couple of days! Small as they may have been, it was a greater acomplashement than anyone has managed before. How do you do this"
pr "Well, I use something I created ages ago, it's a very basic thing that promotes changes in every single offspring, nothing too fancy, I found it by pot luck. But when I apply it to some of the more common cells in humans, expose the relults to viruses the good cells literally just sit there, waiting for me to notice them"
bsg "How much of this mutagen have you got? Have you tried using it on Ebola?"
pr "I-I'm sorry, what?"

pr "Oh, sorry. Um, no. Not yet. Not recently, at least."
bsg "Coudl we run through it now? We have all day, and it's what the world needs right now."
pr "Sure, we can do it now. Grab that incubator over there, Sian, get me a Ebola sample pack"
bsg "This one?"
pr "No, grab the one on the end, the rest aren't clean"
si "Here Sir"

bsg "The airborne what? What you got over there?"

bsg "Ain't that an Ebola sample? It says ebola."
pr "Nah, it's just an old experiment I did years ago, what I made killed the cells, sure, but so would sulfuric acid"
bsg "Heh..."
